### CS394 Final Project
---
* In this project we are planning to evaluate and compare the performance of Ordinary importance sampling algorithm and Weighted importance sampling algorithm, (as given in figure 5.3, page 106 of our textbook) and the performance of n step TD algorithm (pseudo code in page 144 of textbook, chapter 7) and Off-policy n-step Sarsa algorithm (pseudo code in page 149 of textbook, chapter 7). 

* Setup: We run our python notebook for this project in google colab, CPU environment with python 3.10 version.
